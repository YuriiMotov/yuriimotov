### HiðŸ‘‹

I'm Yurii Motov and I'm a Python Software Developer.

I'm looking for a job now. If you like what I do and you want to say thank you to me â€” let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurii-motov/). I would also appreciate if you would [endorse my skills](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a566100).

My current tech stack is: Python, FastAPI, Keycloak, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis, Celery, PyTest, Pydantic, Docker, GIT, NGINX.

Previously I worked with C++, PHP, industrial automation (software development and project managment).

Now I live in Montenegro, but I am ready to move.
