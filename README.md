### Hi!

My name is Yurii Motov and I'm a Python Software Developer.

I'm looking for a job now.

If you like what I do and you want to say 'thank you' to me â€” let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurii-motov/).

**My current tech stack is:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis, Celery, PyTest, Pydantic, ARQ, Docker, NGINX, Keycloak.

Previously I worked with C++, PHP, industrial automation (software development and project managment).

Now I'm living in Montenegro, but I'm ready to relocate.
