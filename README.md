### Hi! 👋

My name is Yurii Motov and I'm a **Python Software Developer** with strong determination to become an expert in several years.

With over **10 years of experience in IT**, I transitioned a couple of years ago into a new field for me - **Python Backend Software Development**.

Given the very limited number of openings for developers with little commercial experience, I've decided to focus on **networking**.

Alongside with learning and practicing, I've been helping others by answering their questions on Stack Overflow and GitHub Discussions for more than 1.5 years.

Feel free to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yurii-motov/)!

🧰 **My current tech stack:** Python 3+, AsyncIO, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Redis, ARQ, PyTest, Pydantic, Docker, Git (GitHub)

🛠️ **I also have basic experience with:** MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Celery, SPARQL (rdflib), LLMs, Weaviate, aioredis, Keycloak

🎯 I focus on writing **clean**, **well-tested**, and **reliable** code.

💼 Previously, I worked with C++, PHP, and in industrial automation (software development and project management).

🌍 I'm currently living in Montenegro.
